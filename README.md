Time Series Forecasting for Daily Minimum Temperatures using XGBRegressor

This project focuses on time series forecasting using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the "Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne" dataset, which contains daily minimum temperature recordings from 1981 to 1990. The goal is to analyze and forecast temperature trends using various data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning method XGBRegressor.
